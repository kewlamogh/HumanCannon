# Phew! *remind me never to do another physics-reliant project*.
# Welcome to HUMAN CANNON!!!

In human cannon you are a very mean alien shooting other people through cannons into water *for the fun of it*. Remember, in this game you are evil so do not hesitate to be evil to those little `jpg` humans (not that they're real). 



# Credits 
Thanks to @Orange-Pear on Scratch for the basic Phsyics algorithm - ported from whatever-language-scratch-uses to JavaScript by me. Thanks to @Blindman on StackOverflow for the `drawImagelookat()` function. Rest of the code by me.

# Fire humans with mouse-click 
You can fire project-human-`jpg`s as long as there is not another one that is currently airborne

# Instructions

Aim with mouse - the cannon will point toward your mouse. Remember, the higher your mouse is during fire, the more the projectile-human-`jpg` will move forward along the x axis.

Fire with mouse click. *Note: The projectile-human-`jpg`s will not fire if there is another one currently airborne*

Enjoy!
